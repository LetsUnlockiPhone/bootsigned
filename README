## We here need ideviceactivate to activate the device

**ideviceactivate is the courtesy of posixninja and his libraries**

git clone http://github.com/posixninja/ideviceactivate.git
cd ideviceactivate 
make

## idevicerestore may be required to run the device as root, so the following can be done:

idevicerestore [-d] [-u] [-c] [-v] [-h] <input.ipsw>

	-v, 		enable incremental levels of verboseness  
	-d, 		enable communication debugging
 	-u, 		target specific device by its 40-digit device 	UUID
  	-h, 		prints usage information
  	-c, 		restore with a custom firmware
  


## idevicerestore may be required to run the device as root, so the following can be done:

./ideviceactivate [-x] [-d] [-h] [-u] [-f]

  -x		deactivate the target device
  -d		enable communication debugging
  -h		prints usage information
  -u UUID	target specific device by its 40-digit device UUID
  -f FILE	activates device with local activation record
